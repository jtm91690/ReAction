# ReAction
Start of HTML/CSS/JS reaction timer game.

Applying what I have learned so far in JS.  This is a small web app that will calculate your reaction time when the user clicks the shape.

The shape will randomly appear within 1-2 seconds, as a random color, and as a random shape of circle or square.

Additional features included are a high score, amount of tries, your average score, and the last 5 attempted scores.
